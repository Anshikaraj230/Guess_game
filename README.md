# Number Guessing Game
Description

This is a simple C++ console application where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it.
After each guess, the program gives feedback:

Too low! if the guess is less than the secret number.
Too high! if the guess is greater than the secret number.
If guessed correctly, the game congratulates the player and shows the number of attempts.
It is a fun and beginner-friendly game that helps practice C++ basics like:
✅ Loops
✅ Conditionals
✅ Random numbers
✅ User input/output
